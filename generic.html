								<p> A CS grad looking for an internship/full-time position in cyber security to leverage my skills and contribute to the company's overall success while providing ample opportunities to grow personally and professionally. Willingness to learn new technologies as necessary for the betterment of my organization and team at the workspace.</p>
								<p> I was in my last year of college, when the pandemic hit. Like many others at the time, I found myself at a bit of loose end. I did my classes online, attended some webinars, and started developing a bunch of new skills, read a bunch of books which made me go on a quest of self discovery on what to do in my life professionally. I’m in search for a meaningful work. ‘Meaningful Work’ means different things for different people, for me it means where I can engage in work that is purposeful, work that impacts the world, work that brings a positive sense of self, work that brings a sense of balance and work that is exciting and also something that challenges me to the core. As I’m a CS grad I narrowed down a few options relating to the tech world and finally decided to go with Cyber Security. In an ever-changing digital landscape, the only certainty is that cybercrime will continue to grow more and more Here things are constantly evolving and new challenges are coming up, one has to think outside the box to tackle with such issues. I’m someone who is not into monotony, I like taking up on challenges that enlarges my limit as a professional and in the cyber industry it is extremely essential to be able to adapt and pivot when necessary because no cyber issue is ever the same. </p>
